Ai Based Crowd Density And Safety Monitoring System


Large public events, such as concerts, festivals, and sports matches, attract massive crowds. While they offer opportunities for social gathering and entertainment, these events also pose significant safety risks, such as overcrowding, stampedes, and panic-induced incidents. Traditional crowd monitoring methods, like manual surveillance and basic CCTV setups, lack the ability to provide real-time insights or predictive capabilities. To address these challenges, the AI-Based Crowd Density and Safety Monitoring System leverages advanced technologies, including Artificial Intelligence (AI), the Internet of Things (IoT), drones, and edge computing. This system enhances safety and crowd management by providing real-time monitoring and predictive risk analysis at large-scale public events.
