Ai Based Crowd Density And Safety Monitoring System


Managing crowd safety at large public events is a critical challenge due to risks like congestion, stampedes, and delayed emergency responses. Traditional surveillance methods often lack the real-time capabilities needed to predict and mitigate such risks. This project aims to address these gaps by developing an AI-based system that integrates Artificial Intelligence (AI), Internet of Things (IoT), and edge computing to enhance crowd management through real-time monitoring and proactive risk assessment.
